					<p>Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.</li>
