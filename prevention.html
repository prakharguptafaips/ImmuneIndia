					Preventing the spread of Covid-19
				</h2>
				<h3>
					<p>Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
					<p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
						<li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
						<li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
						<li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
						<li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
						<li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
						<li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
					<p>Masks</p>
					<p>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
