Immune India
==================
## What this project does
This is an online COVID-19 Vaccination Healthcare portal named “Immune India.” It allows easy access of people in India to COVID-19 vaccination centers around them using just their postal Pin Code.

All that the users have to do is to enter their area’s pin code and the current date in the specified format and hit the “View Vaccination Centers” button. This will take them to a page that will provide them with detailed information about various vaccination centers around them, along with many other details regarding the available dates and time slots, minimum age limit, name of the vaccine, and the available capacity of that vaccine, all in a fraction of a second. As a result, the user will be able to make a quick and clear selection of a vaccination center, date, and time slot for getting vaccinated according to his convenience, eligibility, and the availability of vaccine. 
Apart from this, users can also find some additional information about the preventive measure against the spread of the virus, symptoms of getting affected by the virus, and some treatments for the same, along with direct links to statistics from the official Bing COVID-19 cases and vaccination tracker and latest Coronavirus-related news from CNN. All this effectively makes this portal a one-stop destination for anyone and everyone looking out for getting vaccinated against the virus, or simply looking for the latest COVID-19 updates of happenings around them.

Apart from making the portal easier to use, the main reason behind the usage of postal Pin Codes instead of the city/town name was their specificity and the fact that every locality has its unique Pin Code. This helps provide information related to centers that are actually in close vicinity to the user and thus it does not flood the user with information regarding vaccination centers in far-away or inaccessible locations within his city/town.

When a user enters his Pin Code, the portal looks up the actual location of the area corresponding to that Pin Code on the Indian map and selects all those centers which are located within the specific radius of that Pin Code area from the official directory of vaccination centers maintained by the Indian Government. And since all the information is taken directly from the official websites of those vaccination centers, it is always up-to-date.

Right now, India is in process of running a country-wide vaccination drive for immunity against the Coronavirus. Therefore, the main inspiration behind making this portal came from the idea of making basic information regarding vaccine availability around the common people available to them as easily as possible and trying to make this vaccination drive even more effective than it already is.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
I believe that this project has the potential to have a huge impact on the Indian society towards its goal of making India immune to the Coronavirus.

## What is next for this project
It can potentially be developed into a dedicated mobile app in order to make it even more accessible to the gerenal public.

Moreover, I am also working towards making the interface for the list and details of the centers a bit more appealing to the user.
